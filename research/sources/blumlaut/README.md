## Features

- **Write tags** — pick a filament from your catalog and write it to a blank tag
- **Catalog** — save, edit, and search your filament profiles
- **Filament catalog search** — search 7,000+ filaments from 50+ manufacturers via the bundled [SpoolmanDB](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB) database; tap a result to auto-fill name, material, color, temperature range, diameter, and weight
- **Smart autofill** — type a name like "Elegoo PLA+ White" and material, subtype, and color fill in automatically
- **Network Connectivity** — configure your printer's IP and see which filaments are currently installed, wirelessly import their profiles into the app!

## Credits

The tag encoding format is based on community reverse-engineering by [DnG-Crafts](https://github.com/DnG-Crafts/ELG-RFID) and [Savion](https://github.com/Savion/elegoo-rfid-editor). Many thanks to both for their thorough work. The official ELEGOO documentation contains errors and should not be relied upon.

The filament catalog search is powered by [SpoolmanDB](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB) by [Donkie](https://github.com/Donkie) — a community-maintained database of 3D printing filaments and manufacturers. Used under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB/blob/main/LICENSE). The database is downloaded at build time and bundled as an offline asset.
