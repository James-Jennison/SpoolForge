## Project Status

* **Project status**: MAINTENANCE MODE
* **Published records**: 53,355
* **P0/P1**: Complete
* **P2/P3**: Complete
* **Backlog location**: [docs/coverage-backlog.md](docs/coverage-backlog.md)
* **Maintenance guide**: [docs/maintenance.md](docs/maintenance.md)

## What this is

SpoolmanDB Community is an actively maintained community extension of SpoolmanDB, focused on faster filament updates, provenance, data quality, public-ID stability, and compatibility with the actively developed Spoolman application.

### Upstream Relationships & Positioning

* **Active Application Upstream**: [Donkie/Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman) — The actively developed application server that consumes external filament data via its `ExternalFilament` contract (`spoolman/externaldb.py`).
* **Original Data Upstream**: [Donkie/SpoolmanDB](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB) — The original upstream static dataset. Repository activity resumed in August 2026 with contributor tooling and catalog-preview automation; Community remains independently maintained while upstream data PRs are reviewed on their own timeline.
* **SpoolmanDB-Community Position**: An independent community extension and staging-quality dataset. It is **not** a replacement application fork, but a community-driven database maintaining strict quality controls, public-ID stability, and rich metadata extensions.
* **Contract Compatibility**: Compatible with Spoolman's pinned stable release (`v0.25.0`) and monitored against the `master` canary. See the detailed [Upstream Compatibility & Divergence Tracker](docs/UPSTREAM_COMPATIBILITY.md).
* **Public ID Stability**: Every published filament record is protected by an automated PR-base baseline stability gate (`contracts/compiled_id_baseline.json`) ensuring historical IDs never disappear or change accidentally.
* **Community Extensions**: Metadata such as Country of Origin (COO), SDS/TDS document links, manufacturer article codes, and EAN/GTIN barcodes are maintained as Community extensions.

## Key Enhancements & Differences from Upstream

SpoolmanDB Community introduces several structural, validation, and metadata improvements over the original `Donkie/SpoolmanDB` project:

*   **Native & Strict Quality Controls**:
    *   **Unified Validation**: Uses a native Python validation script ([validate.py](scripts/validate.py)) powered by `jsonschema` instead of relying on external CLI tools.
    *   **Rigid Compiler Checks**: A compiled schema ([filaments.compiled.schema.json](filaments.compiled.schema.json)) strictly validates the final compiled database to prevent broken data structures, bad IDs, or invalid formats from shipping.
    *   **Unit Test Suite**: Includes automated compiler unit testing using `pytest` ([test_compile.py](tests/test_compile.py)) to safeguard ID normalization, multi-color constraints, and manufacturer duplicate checks.
*   **Editor Experience**:
    *   Workspace configurations ([settings.json](.vscode/settings.json)) bind schemas to JSON files in the IDE, offering real-time diagnostics, autocomplete, and inline linting.
*   **Expanded Data & Metadata**:
    *   **Additional Metadata**: Full compiler passthrough for source-backed fields including `country_of_origin`, `sds_url`, `tds_url`, `codes`, `eans`, and `eans_refill` from source profiles to the final database.
    *   **Modern Materials**: Added missing material definitions in [materials.json](materials.json) (`BVOH`, `CoPE`, `PP`, `PAHT`, `PPA`, `PPS`, `PET`).
    *   **Massive Brand Updates**: Broad coverage of popular consumer, local, industrial, and community brands such as Bambu Lab, Polymaker, Spectrum, Threebees, Filamax, ProtoFil, Cubic3, and more.
    *   **ASEAN & Local-Market Coverage**: Source-backed local filament data across Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, with current totals generated in the snapshot below.
    *   **Refill & Spool Type Support**: Source data can preserve `plastic`, `cardboard`, `metal`, legacy `refill`, and legacy `unknow` evidence. The published Spoolman contract emits only `plastic`, `cardboard`, `metal`, or `null`, with refill packaging preserved separately as `is_refill`.

## Current snapshot

<!-- readme-snapshot:start -->
| Source | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Manufacturer source files | 489 |
| Material definitions | 153 |
| Source filament objects | 5,040 |
| Color entries | 31,130 |
| Compiled filament variants | 53,355 |
| Source filaments with country of origin | 4,584 |
| Source filaments with TDS/product links | 1,137 |
| Source filaments with SDS links | 382 |
| Manufacturer product code/ID entries | 8,166 |
| EAN/GTIN entries | 2,194 |
| ASEAN manufacturer coverage | 24 brands / 147 source filaments |

Counts in this block are generated from the current repository state. Run `python scripts/readme_snapshot.py --write` after source-data changes. The compiled variant count expands source data across color, diameter, weight, and spool combinations.

### Spool metadata snapshot

| Source weight metadata | Entries |
| --- | ---: |
| `spool_type: plastic` | 4,320 |
| `spool_type: cardboard` | 1,656 |
| `spool_type: metal` | 0 |
| `spool_type: refill` (legacy) | 34 |
| `spool_type: unknow` (legacy) | 26 |
| `spool_type: null` | 0 |
| `spool_type` omitted | 272 |
| Effective refill (`is_refill: true` or legacy `spool_type: refill`) | 54 |
<!-- readme-snapshot:end -->

ASEAN coverage uses the curated [ASEAN manufacturer registry](scripts/asean_manufacturers.json); it is never inferred from `country_of_origin`, which records manufacturing origin rather than brand location.

The source database intentionally preserves the historical `unknow` spelling for ID and curation stability. New spool values should be evidence-backed; do not infer spool material from vague marketing phrases alone. New refill entries should use `is_refill: true`; the legacy source value `spool_type: "refill"` remains accepted so existing IDs do not change.

### Spoolman compatibility contract

`spool_type` in the published `filaments.json` describes physical spool material and is restricted to the values accepted by Spoolman. Community-only refill metadata is emitted as the additional boolean `is_refill`. The public Community JSON and Explorer retain that distinction; current Spoolman accepts the extra field but drops it when serializing data into its own cache.

| Source weight metadata | Published `spool_type` | Published `is_refill` |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `plastic`, `cardboard`, or `metal` | same value | `false` |
| legacy `refill` or `is_refill: true` | `null` | `true` |
| legacy `unknow`, `null`, or omitted | `null` | `false` |

Compatibility is checked in three layers:

1. Compiler normalization uses an explicit allowlist and preserves historical ID suffixes.
2. The compiled schema rejects values outside Spoolman's public enum.
3. Normal builds validate every record against a **required stable pin** of Spoolman's `ExternalFilament` contract. Version and commit are defined only in [`contracts/spoolman_upstream.json`](contracts/spoolman_upstream.json). CI uses the reviewed offline snapshot [`contracts/spoolman_externaldb.py`](contracts/spoolman_externaldb.py) so merge checks are deterministic and network-free. Details: [docs/spoolman-compatibility.md](docs/spoolman-compatibility.md).

A separate **canary** check fetches current `Donkie/Spoolman:master`, validates against it, and reports exactly which `ExternalFilament` fields or types changed relative to the stable pin. Canary failures are visible in CI (job summary + warning) but **do not block data PRs**. The weekly [Spoolman compatibility workflow](.github/workflows/spoolman-compatibility.yml) also runs **pin integrity** (`--mode verify-pin`): it fetches the configured stable commit and asserts the local snapshot still matches, without changing offline PR CI.

## Data model at a glance

Source files stay small enough to review by hand. The compiler validates and expands them into the flat JSON contract consumed by Spoolman.

## Contributor workflow

1. Add or edit manufacturer source files in `filaments/`.
2. Keep the pull request focused: one manufacturer, one correction set, or one schema change.
3. Link manufacturer product pages, datasheets, SDS/TDS files, or other evidence.
4. Run validation and tests locally before opening a pull request.

First install developer dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Then compile, validate, and test:

```powershell
python scripts/readme_snapshot.py --write
python scripts/compile_filaments.py
python scripts/validate.py
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/check_spoolman_compat.py --mode stable
# Optional advisory check against Donkie/Spoolman master (does not block merge):
python scripts/check_spoolman_compat.py --mode canary
```

## Data model

The source files in `filaments/` are intentionally compact. Deployment expands them into one generated `filaments.json` file. If a source entry has two diameters, two spool weights, and five colors, it becomes twenty compiled filament variants.

<details>
<summary>Filament source fields</summary>

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes | Product or product-line name. Usually contains `{color_name}` so each color expands into a readable compiled name. Follow manufacturer naming; do not add `material` here unless it is part of the official product name. |
| `material` | yes | Authoritative material code, such as `PLA`, `PETG`, `ABS`, `TPU-95A`, or schema-supported composites. |
| `density` | yes | Material density in g/cm3. |
| `weights` | yes | Array of `weight`, optional `spool_weight`, optional physical `spool_type`, and optional `is_refill`. Prefer `is_refill: true` for spoolless products; legacy `spool_type: "refill"` remains accepted for ID stability. |
| `diameters` | yes | Filament diameters in mm, commonly `1.75` or `2.85`. |
| `colors` | yes | Color objects with `name` plus either `hex` or `hexes`. |
| `extruder_temp` | optional | Recommended extruder temperature in degrees Celsius. |
| `extruder_temp_range` | optional | Two-value temperature range, such as `[190, 230]`. |
| `bed_temp` | optional | Recommended bed temperature in degrees Celsius. |
| `bed_temp_range` | optional | Two-value bed temperature range. |
| `finish` | optional | `matte` or `glossy`; only set when the product is designed that way. |
| `multi_color_direction` | optional | `coaxial` for split/side-by-side colors or `longitudinal` for color changes along the filament length. |
| `pattern` | optional | Currently `marble` or `sparkle`. |
| `translucent` | optional | Boolean for partially see-through filament. |
| `glow` | optional | Boolean for glow-in-the-dark filament. |
| `country_of_origin` | optional | Manufacturing country as ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (`US`, `CN`, `DE`, …). Full names and non-ISO strings are rejected. |
| `sds_url` | optional | Safety Data Sheet URL. |
| `tds_url` | optional | Technical Data Sheet URL. |

Color entries can override `finish`, `multi_color_direction`, `pattern`, `translucent`, and `glow` when a specific color differs from the product default. They can also include `codes`, `eans`, and `eans_refill` arrays for manufacturer product codes, SKUs, or platform variant IDs and spooled/refill EAN or GTIN barcodes.

### Display names and upstream compatibility

Compiled `name` values stay upstream-compatible with [Donkie/SpoolmanDB](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB): the compiler expands the source template and color only. `material` remains a separate field.

The Community Explorer may compose `material + name` for display and search when the product name does not already contain the material as its own token. For example, `name: "Plus BLACK"` with `material: "ABS"` is stored as-is in `filaments.json`, while Explorer shows `ABS Plus BLACK`.

`python scripts/validate.py` prints non-blocking `WARN display-name` hints for ambiguous templates. Use `--strict-display-names` only when you want that check to fail validation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Material source fields</summary>

All shared material defaults live in `materials.json`.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `material` | yes | Material name, such as `PLA`. |
| `density` | yes | Density in g/cm3. |
| `extruder_temp` | optional | General extruder temperature. |
| `bed_temp` | optional | General bed temperature. |
